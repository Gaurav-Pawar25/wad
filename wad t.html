    /* Assignment 1:
    a. Create a responsive web page which shows the ecommerce/college/exam admin dashboard
    with sidebar and statistics in cards using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
    Theory:
    I. HTML
    ● HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    ● HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
    ● HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    ● HTML consists of a series of elements
    ● HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    ● HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph",
    "this is a link", etc
    ● The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    ● The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    ● The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    ● The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's
    title bar or in the page's tab)
    ● The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible
    contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    ● The <h1> element defines a large heading
    ● The <p> element defines a paragraph
    II. CSS
    ● CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    ● CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other
    media
    ● CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    ● External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
    ● CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and
    variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
    III. Bootstrap
    Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive
    websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
    developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of
    which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the
    browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and
    Phones).
    Why Bootstrap?
    ● Faster and Easier Web Development.
    ● It creates Platform-independent web pages.
    ● It creates Responsive Web-pages.
    ● It is designed to be responsive to mobile devices too.
    ● It is Free! Available on www.getbootstrap.com
    . Write a JavaScript Program to get the user registration data and push to array/local
    storage with AJAX POST method and data list in new page.
    AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better,
    faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
    Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and
    JavaScript for dynamic content display.
    Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous
    requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new
    information from the server.
    With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the
    results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that
    anything was even transmitted to the server. XML is commonly used as the format for receiving
    server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used. AJAX is a web browser
    technology independent
    of web server software.
    A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from
    the server in the background. Intuitive and natural user interaction. Clicking is not required,
    mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger. Data-driven as opposed to page-driven.
    AJAX is based on the following open standards −
    ● Browser-based presentation using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
    ● Data is stored in XML format and fetched from the server.
    ● Behind-the-scenes data fetches using XMLHttpRequest objects in the browser.
    ● JavaScript to make everything happen
    AJAX cannot work independently. It is used in combination with other
    technologies to create interactive webpages.
    • JavaScript
    – Loosely typed scripting language.
    – JavaScript function is called when an event occurs in a page.
    – Glue for the whole AJAX operation.
    • DOM
    – API for accessing and manipulating structured documents.
    – Represents the structure of XML and HTML documents.
    • CSS
    – Allows for a clear separation of the presentation style from the content
    and may be changed programmatically by JavaScript
    • XMLHttpRequest
    – JavaScript object that performs asynchronous interaction with the server.
    Assignment 2:
    a. Create version control account on GitHub and using Git commands to create
    repository and push your code to GitHub.
    b. Create Docker Container Environment (NVIDEIA Docker or any other).
    c. Create an Angular application which will do following actions: Register User, Login
    User, Show User Data on Profile Component
    Theory:
    Part a.
    1. What is Git?
    Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been
    maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
    It is used for:
    ● Tracking code changes
    ● Tracking who made changes
    ● Coding collaboration
    2. What does Git do?
    ● Manage projects with Repositories
    ● Clone a project to work on a local copy
    ● Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
    ● Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
    ● Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
    ● Push local updates to the main project
    3. Working with Git
    ● Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
    ● Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
    ● When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
    ● You select the modified files you want to Stage
    ● The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the
    files
    ● Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
    ● You can revert back to any previous commit.
    ● Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of
    changes made in each commit!
    4. Why Git?
    ● Over 70% of developers use Git!
    ● Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
    ● Developers can see the full history of the project.
    ● Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
    5. What is GitHub
    ● Git is not the same as GitHub.
    ● GitHub makes tools that use Git.
    ● GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft
    since 2018.
    Assignment 3:
    a. Create a Node.JS Application which serves a static website.
    b. Create four API using Node.JS, ExpressJS and MongoDB for CURD Operations on assignment
    2.C.
    Theory:
    Part a:
    Create a Node.JS Application which serves a static website.
    Installation : Node.js (site – Node.js), Express.js(installed through cmd)
    Theory :
    Node.js overview
    In basic terms, Node is an open source cross-platform library for server-side programming that
    permits clients to develop web applications rapidly. With Node, we can execute JavaScript
    applications or network applications. Its basic modules are engraved in JavaScript.
    It is generally utilized for server applications in real-time. Node.js permits JavaScript to execute
    locally on a machine or a server.
    Node.js gives numerous systems to utilize. One of such structures is Express.js. It is more
    valuable and mainstream than the different structures of Node.js.
    Features of Node.js
    ● Versatility: Node is incredibly adaptable as the server reacts in a non-blocking way.
    ● Zero Buffering: Applications yield the measurements in enormous pieces. This gives the
    advantage of ‘No buffering’ to developers.
    ● Network: Node.js upholds an open-source community. This is the main explanation that
    numerous glorious modules have been added to Node.js applications over time.
    ● Occasion driven Input and output: APIs of Node.js are non-blocking, meaning that the
    server won’t wait for the arrival of information from an API. Rather, it will move to
    another API.
    Advantages of Node.js
    ● Easy to learn: Nodeis quite simple for developers to utilize and learn. Learning Node.js
    is less difficult than React.
    ● Better Performance: Node.js takes the code of JavaScript via Google’s V8 JavaScript
    engine. The main advantage of this process is that it complies with the JavaScript code
    directly into the machine code
    ● Freedom: Node.js offers a lot of freedom when it comes to development. There are
    generally less constraints with Node.
    ● Extended support for tools: Another advantage of Node.js is that developers have more
    community support.
    ● Extensible: Node.js is known to be quite extensible. You can utilize JSON to give the
    degree to trade of information between the web server and the client.
    ● Scalability: Node.js makes it simple to scale applications in horizontal as well as
    vertical directions. The applications can be scaled even by the option of extra hubs to
    the current framework.
    Limitations of Node.js
    ● Programming interface isn’t steady: The Application Programming Interface (API) of
    Node can be challenging to work with. It changes regularly and doesn’t remain stable.
    ● No strong library support system: JavaScript does not hold a strong library system. This
    limits the developers to implement even common programming tasks using Node.js.
    ● Programming model is not synchronous: Many developers find this programming model
    tougher in comparison to linear blocking I/O programming. In asynchronous
    programming, the codes become clumsier, and developers have to depend on the nes
    Express.js
    "Express is a fast, unopinionated minimalist web framework for Node.js" - official web
    site: Expressjs.com
    Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides various features that make
    web application development fast and easy which otherwise takes more time using only Node.js.
    Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn
    uses http module. So, any middleware which is based on connect will also work with Express.js.
    Advantages of Express.js
    1. Makes Node.js web application development fast and easy.
    2. Easy to configure and customize.
    3. Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.
    4. Includes various middleware modules which you can use to perform additional tasks on
    request and response.
    5. Easy to integrate with different template engines like Jade, Vash, EJS etc.
    6. Allows you to define an error handling middleware.
    7. Easy to serve static files and resources of your application.
    8. Allows you to create REST API server.
    9. Easy to connect with databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL
    Steps :
    1. Install Node.js
    2. Setting up express.js
    3. Structuring files
    4. Creating your express server
    5. Servicing your static files
    6. Building your web page
    7. Running your project
    Open Node.js command terminal & run the following in your terminalSetting up express.js
    1. Create a new directory for your project - mkdir your-project-name
    2. Change into your new directory - cd your-project-name
    3. Initialize a new Node project with defaults. This will set a package.json file to access your
    dependencies: npm init -y
    4. Create your entry file, index.js. This is where you will store your Express server: if you are
    working on Linux, you can run : touch index.js. if you are working on windows, you can
    edit in VSCode
    5. Install Express as a dependency : npm install express –save
    6. Edit package.json. Within your package.json, update your start script to include node and
    your index.js file.
    Let express-static-file-tutorial is your project name
    Package.json
    {
    "name": "express-static-file-tutorial",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js" // change start value as node index.js
    }, // This will allow you to use the npm start command in your terminal to
    launch
    "keywords": [], your express server
    "author": "Paul Halliday",
    "license": "MIT"
    }
    Structuring Your Files
    To store your files on the client-side, create a public directory and include an index.html file
    express-static-file-tutorial
    |- index.js
    |- public
    |- index.html
    Creating Your Express Server
    Edit index.js file
    Index.js
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const PORT = 3000;
    app.use(express.static('public')); // represents application is serving static webpage in public
    directory
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server listening on port: ${PORT}`));
    First of all, import the Express.js module.
    In the above example, we imported Express.js module using require() function. The express
    module returns a function. This function returns an object which can be used to configure
    Express application (app in the above example).
    The app object includes methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering
    HTML views and registering a template engine.
    The app.listen() function creates the Node.js web server at the specified host and port. It is
    identical to Node's http.Server.listen() method. Instead of Get(), post(), put() and delete()
    methods can be used.
    Building Your Web Page – client side
    Navigate to your index.html file in the public directory. Populate the file with body and image
    elements:
    [label index.html] 
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <img src="shark.png" alt="shark"> //download & store image in public directory
    </body>
    </html>
    (Instead of building Hello world application, building applications like student’s Registration
    form/main page of website is recommended)
    Running Your Project
    In your terminal, launch your Express project
    npm start
    It will display
    Server listening on port : 3000
    Open your web browser, and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
